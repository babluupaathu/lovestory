        <p>It all started when he transferred to my school in 8th grade. Initially, they didn’t talk much as she was an introvert, and he was experiencing a new environment. One year passed, and during 9th grade, when online classes were taking place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she was feeling bored one day and decided to send him a message. Their conversation grew from friends to best friends.</p>
        
        <p>One day, he proposed to her, and she was in great shock. She didn’t expect this from him and didn’t have those kinds of feelings for him at the time. Out of anger, she blocked him for months. Later, she unblocked him and tried to make him understand her feelings, but he declined and continued to love her for a year and a half.</p>
        
        <p>Eventually, she began to develop feelings for him but was scared to convey them due to their different backgrounds. Her friends found out and conveyed her feelings to him. On April 4th, 2022, they officially became a couple.</p>
        
        <p>This is just a part of their love story; there are hidden aspects that have not been conveyed, as every love story has two faces that can’t be shown to the public.</p>

        <h2>Note the Point</h2>
        <p>In relationships, there may be fights and arguments, and there is no such thing as a perfect couple. There should be understanding between partners rather than mere commitment. If a mistake is made, a second chance should be given to help them realize it, but further chances may lead to a toxic relationship. Freedom is essential for both partners, and remember: where there is trust, there is love.</p>
